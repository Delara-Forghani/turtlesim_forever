As you may know turtlesim provides a simple simulator for teaching ROS concepts.
This project is a basic program which shows how to spawn several turtles on the screen.It also works on their motions .
So users can take control of one turtle at a time, they can also switch between the turtles using E and W keys.

* $ roslaunch turtle_sim onlysim.launch
* $ roslaunch spawn turtleSpawn.launch
