# turtlesim_forever
As you may know turtlesim provides a simple simulator for teaching ROS concepts.
This project is a basic program which shows how to spawn several turtles on the screen.It also works on their motions .
So Users can take control of one turtle at a time, they can also switch between the turtles using E and W keys. 
First try to call roslaunch for "multisim.launch" in "turtlesim" package,then in order to spawn five turtles you need to call roslaunch for "turtleSpawn.launch" in "spawn1" package ,you can also make them move by launching "turtle_teleop_aut.launch" exists in "spawn1" package.


This project is in affiliation with CRLab at AmirKabir university of Technology.
