# turtlesim_forever


As you may know turtlesim provides a simple simulator for teaching ROS concepts.
This project is a basic program which shows how to spawn several turtles on the screen.It also works on their motions .
So users can take control of one turtle at a time, they can also switch between the turtles using E and W keys. 


#Running the tests

$ roslaunch turtlesim multisim.launch
$ roslaunch spawn1 turtleSpawn.launch 
$ roslaunch spawn1 subscribe.launch
$ roslaunch spawn1 publish.launch
$ roslaunch spawn1 turtle_teleop_aut.launch
